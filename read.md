Career Services:<br>
- White Board:<br>
    - I’ve attended at least three white board firesides. Mick was leading when I completed a problem. I realized that I don’t know what a for loop looks like when you write it on a white board instead of VS code. I think I did a good job of talking the problem out when I was stumped. A whiteboard is where I like to plan out my project, so being at the white board feel pretty natural. However, coding on a white board is pretty nerve racking. I noticed some people get stuck and freeze up little bit, while I’m more likely to laugh or joke around.<br><br>
- QUESTIONS<br>
    1. Is there anything form the interview that you would like me to elaborate on?<br>
    2. What are the next steps in the hiring process?<br>
    3. What do you think makes ___ company a great place to work?<br>
    4. What does it take to be successful here?<br>
    5. What are your company values, and how do they impact the work here?<br>
- ELEVATOR PITCH<br>
- HOW SHOULD I PREPARE?<br>
- To prepare I will research the company and find out what their values are. If applicable I will see what I can find out about the person interviewing me. I will closely look at the job description and use this information to prepare and highlight things they’re looking for in a candidate. <br>
- BEHAVIOR QUESTIONS<br>
- Tell me about a time an unexpected problem derailed your planning. How did you recover?<br>
    - SITUATION I was working for a local promoter and one of the venues we had a show at was an amphitheater on the edge of town. Part of my job was to ensure the gates were ready for patrons to enter. Our staff informed me that they tested the ticket scanners and the wifi was down. <br>
    - TASK I had to figure out how to fix the wifi and or come up with a different way to scan tickets so the patrons could enter the show.<br>
    - ACTION I asked the event staff if they were willing to download a mobile app on their devices to scan tickets, I also asked some of my colleagues if they had a hotspot they’d be willing to loan out. <br>
    - RESULTS This solution allowed patrons to enter the venue at the scheduled time and gave me some time to troubleshoot and see if I could get our internet back up. <br>
- Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service. <br>
    1. SITUATION When I was working for the promoter there was a local band that performed a Christmas concert every year. This concert was a Christmas tradition for many locals in the area. We had several customers that would call in looking for seats for their family. There was one particular customer who wanted to purchased multiple tickets to multiple performances of this show. <br>
    2. TASK I needed to help this patron select seats to the concert, however when I tried to run their payment, it failed due to the amount of the order. The lady needed to call her bank and approve, but was worried about losing her seats. <br>
    3. ACTION I told her I could place the seats in a temporary hold for the rest of the day, until she could call her bank and call back to purchase these tickets. <br>
    4. RESULTS The patron was grateful that her seats were safe and she could attend the concert with her family. <br>
- Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?<br>
    1. SITUATION I worked at a winery in California for a harvest. During harvest all the grapes are brought in from the vineyards and it’s not uncommon for employess to be working 12+ hours 6 days a week. <br>
    2. TASK Each morning when I arrived I’d be handed a stack of work orders to be completed and assigned to work with someone.
    3. ACTION I would always sort through the stack and start to break into parts. For example we had 8 cellars at the winery and if we had a bunch of additions to add to the wine I would break it down by cellar so we could knock them off one cellar at a time. If we were moving wine between tanks, I would look at the movements and decide which ones to do first to be the most efficient. If we need to do movements on white wine and red wine, you should always move the white wine first, because the red wine can discolor and taint white wine and the only way to prevent that is to circulate a sanitizer through the line. <br>
    4. RESULTS My manager appreciated my ability to efficiently complete work orders and save time on process through out the day. 
- Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone at work to see things your way.<br>
        1. Bobcat: Jeff on the article in the Doosan Dirt
    1. SITUATION At Doosan Bobcat I designed and sent out an employee newsletter once a week called the Doosan Dirt. IT included company updates, IT updates, HR information, and employee stories. Each story has a small snippet and a link to read more. I had sent a rough draft of the design to my manager and was waiting approval. 
    2. TASK My manager wanted to lengthen one of the story snippets in the newsletter by a considerable amount. I knew including this much text one one story in the newsletter would throw off the spacing and be a bit over whelming for an intro to a story. <br>
    3. ACTION I put my managers copy into the newsletter and took a screenshot, and then inserted the copy I thought was appropriate and took a screenshot. I then sent these to my manager and explained why I thought the snippet copy should be shortened. <br>
    4. RESULTS With the visual my screenshots provided, my manager totally agreed  that the copy needed to be shortened for the newsletter. He sent me a new shorter copy that met our goals. <br>
- Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment<br>
    1. SITUATION I was in charge of ticket sales and managing event staff at shows for a local promoter. However, my professional goal was to be in the marking field. <br>
    2. TASK I approached my boss and asked if I could start managing the ticketing side of social media and if I could implement some marketing strategies in our ticket sales. He approved it and told me to touch base with the marketing team for approval on content. <br>
    3. ACTION I started with creating some posts regarding upcoming events. These posts included door times, if tickets were available at the door, and general venue rules. On the sales side I implement checkout surveys that asked patrons about their experience and allowed them to subscribe to our email newsletter. 
    4. RESULTS I was able to implement marketing experience into my job and increase our customer engagement. <br>
